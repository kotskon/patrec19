# README.md
In contrast to the rest of the lab exercises, this one was hosted on [kaggle][kg]. So the folder is not self-contained, and can't be reproduced locally (unless the data are first downloaded from kaggle). Moreover, note that due to the tasks implemented, the use of a GPU is more than recommended.
